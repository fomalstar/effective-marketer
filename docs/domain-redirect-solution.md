# Domain Redirect Solution for Blog Posts

## Problem
- **Backend**: `effective-marketer-dashboard.onrender.com` (serves blog posts)
- **Main Site**: `effectivemarketer.com` (where users expect blog posts)
- **SEO Issue**: Blog posts need to appear on main domain for SEO

## Solution: Domain Redirects

### Option 1: Render Static Site Redirects (Recommended)
Since your main site is on Render Static Site, we can use Render's redirect functionality.

#### Implementation:
1. **Create `_redirects` file** in your main site's `public/` directory
2. **Redirect blog requests** to backend domain
3. **Maintain SEO value** with proper redirects

#### `public/_redirects` file:
```
# Redirect blog posts to backend
/blog/* https://effective-marketer-dashboard.onrender.com/blog/:splat 200

# Redirect blog index
/blog https://effective-marketer-dashboard.onrender.com/blog 200
```

### Option 2: DNS/Server-Level Redirects
If Render doesn't support redirects for Static Sites, we can:
1. Use a service like Netlify for redirects
2. Set up a proxy server
3. Use Cloudflare for redirects

### Option 3: Update All Links to Backend
- Change all internal links to point to backend domain
- Update sitemap to use backend domain
- Less ideal for SEO but simpler

## Recommended Approach: Render Redirects

### Steps:
1. ✅ **Backend ready** - Blog posts served from backend
2. ⏳ **Create redirects** - Set up `_redirects` file
3. ⏳ **Test redirects** - Verify they work
4. ⏳ **Update sitemap** - Ensure SEO URLs are correct
5. ⏳ **Monitor** - Check for any issues

### Benefits:
- ✅ **SEO friendly** - Blog posts appear on main domain
- ✅ **User friendly** - Seamless experience
- ✅ **No extra cost** - Uses existing infrastructure
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update

### Testing:
After implementation, test:
- `https://effectivemarketer.com/blog` → should redirect to backend
- `https://effectivemarketer.com/blog/slug` → should redirect to backend
- SEO tools should see content on main domain
- No broken links or 404s
