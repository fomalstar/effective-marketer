# Server Fix Explanation

## Problem
The Render deployment was failing with this error:
```
PathError [TypeError]: Missing parameter name at index 1: *; visit https://git.new/pathToRegexpError for info
```

## Root Cause
The issue was with the wildcard route syntax in Express:
```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
```

In newer versions of Express and the `path-to-regexp` library, the `*` wildcard syntax has changed and is no longer supported in the same way.

## Solution
Changed the wildcard route from:
```javascript
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
```

To:
```javascript
app.use((req, res) => {
```

## Why This Works
- `app.use()` is the correct way to handle catch-all routes in Express 4.18.2
- It catches all requests that haven't been handled by previous routes
- This avoids the `path-to-regexp` compatibility issues with wildcard syntax
- It maintains the same functionality while being compatible with the current Express version

## Result
- ✅ Server should now start successfully on Render
- ✅ All routes will be handled properly
- ✅ SEO meta tags will be injected correctly
- ✅ React app will load and render

## Next Steps
1. The server should now deploy successfully
2. Test all routes to ensure they work
3. Verify SEO meta tags are unique per page
4. Check that Google can see different content for each route
